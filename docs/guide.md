# Getting Started

**vue3-marquee** is a simple marquee component for Vue 3 that creates customizable marquees. This component uses slots for your content and props for any config options.

The latest version is still slightly experimental in terms of typescript support.

## Introduction

`vue3-marquee` was born from an internal need for a quick and easy marquee component that I wanted to use in our website homepage. Many of the component libraries that I found were either unmaintained, complex or not compatible with Vue 3. This component should also work for you if you would like to use a marquee component that just works out of the box and is customizable to fit your use case.

In my search for a good marquee component, I found a React library that seemed to do what I wanted so I decided to emulate the component in Vue 3 for anyone to use. The original React library can be found [here](https://www.react-fast-marquee.com/).

In `vue3-marquee` you have the option of cloning content to remove any empty spaces for marquee elements that don't fit the width of the container. This will allow you to have seamless content that just works.

## Changes from v1

With version 2, typescript support has been added. It's currently in the beta phase but when I get some results from other devs using this library with typescript projects, I will push a full release to npm.

The options object has been removed since it was adding additional code on the backend to handle. All options for the component should now be passed via template props.

The clone attribute has been marked as experimental for the moment. If the options gives you strange artifacts or isn't what you are looking for, please just create a copy of your content to fit the width of your container.

The `direction` prop has now changed to use the css value of `normal` or `reverse` natively. Use these as your passed props.

The `gradientWidth` prop has been modified to only accept string attributes. Pass a valid css unit to adjust the width of the gradient.

## Playground

You can use the already setup code sandbox to play around with the library and test out the funcionality. [Use this link to go to the playground](https://codesandbox.io/s/vue3-marquee-sandbox-09zm5?file=/src/App.vue).

## Installation

### NPM

You can install `vue3-marquee` over `yarn` or `npm`. The only dependency required is Vue 3 which should automatically be supplied by your Vue 3 page.

```bash
yarn add vue3-marquee
```

```bash
npm install vue3-marquee --save
```

### Browser CDN

You can also use `vue3-marquee` directly in the browser via CDN.

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/vue3-marquee@0.0.4/dist/vue3-marquee.min.js"></script>
```

## Usage

The most common use case is to register the component globally.

```js
// main.js
import { createApp } from "vue";
import Vue3Marquee from "vue3-marquee";

createApp(App).use(Vue3Marquee).mount("#app");
```

Alternatively you can import the marquee component locally.

```vue
<template>
  <vue3-marquee>
    <img height="200" src="...img" />
    <img height="200" src="...img" />
    <img height="200" src="...img" />
  </vue3-marquee>
</template>

<script>
import Vue3Marquee from "vue3-marquee";

export default {
  components: {
    Vue3Marquee,
  },
};
</script>
```
