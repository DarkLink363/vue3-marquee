A simple marquee component with ZERO dependencies for Vue 3. This component was originally developed for internal use but I figured this could be useful to someone else as well. This component is modeled after a React marquee component I found called [React Fast Marquee](https://github.com/justin-chu/react-fast-marquee). To keep a smooth animation running, clones of the content can be created for seamless transitions with no sudden jarring appearences or empty spaces in between content.

# Installation

If you are using npm:

```shell
npm install vue3-marquee
```

If you are using yarn:

```shell
yarn add vue3-marquee
```

# Usage

The most common use case is to register the component globally.

```js
// main.js
import { createApp } from "vue";
import Vue3Marquee from "vue3-marquee";

createApp(App).use(Vue3Marquee).mount("#app");
```

Alternatively you can import the marquee component locally.

```js
import Vue3Marquee from "vue3-marquee";

export default {
  components: {
    Vue3Marquee,
  },
};
```

You can then use the component in your template. A common use case is an image marquee for logos but you can also use it for scrolling text.

```html
<vue3-marquee>
  <img height="200" width="300" src="...img" />
  <img height="200" width="300" src="...img" />
  <img height="200" width="300" src="...img" />
</vue3-marquee>
```
